    "Priya works at an international PR firm in the Europe division. Their largest client has offices in Ibiza, Madrid, and Las Palmas. She needs to keep her boss aware of current events and provide a weekly short list of articles concerning political events in Spain. The problem is, this takes hours every week to review articles on the BBC and Priya is very busy! She wonders if she could automate this process using text mining to save her time."
